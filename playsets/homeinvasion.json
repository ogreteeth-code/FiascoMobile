		"But lately things have been unsettled around Poppleton Terrace - property values are falling, crime is rising, long-time residents have been less than receptive to the suggestions of the standards committee, and now new people are moving in.",
		"People who are not like us. At all.",
		"FURTHER FIASCOS",
